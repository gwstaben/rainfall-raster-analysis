    "Step 1. Produce the rainfall totals for a given period. Currently the total rainfall is calculated between May and April. For example, if the reporting year is 2021 the total rainfall is calculated between the months May 2020 to April 2021,  this takes into account the influence of rainfall for the 2021 growing season. The script \"seasonal_rainfall_calcs.py\" is used to produce these products. Note: Historic total rainfall raster layers (1989 to prevous reporting year) should exist in the rainfall directory however you will need to produce the current year. \n",

    "\n",
    "The AU total rainfall raster is then clipped to the NT boundary for further analysis and then clip out the NT. The user defines the file name and should follow the convention as shown here: NT_202105202204_total_rainfall_a2.tif \"NT_total_rainfall__a2.tif\"     \n",
